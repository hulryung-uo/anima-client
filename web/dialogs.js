// ── dialog window lifecycle ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One implementation of "keep a set of windows in sync with the current scene
// snapshot", shared by every server-driven dialog family (generic gumps, legacy
// menus, hue pickers, trades, maps, containers, book, shop, popup, prompt,
// text-entry, profiles, the house-design panel).
//
// Why this exists rather than a refresh function per family: the snapshot in
// `scene` is POLLED, so one that was BUILT BEFORE our reply reached the server
// still lists a dialog the player just answered. Every family therefore has to
// remember what it dismissed and skip it until the server catches up, or the
// window visibly pops back for one poll before closing for good. That's four
// steps (record on close, skip while dismissed, drop the record once the item
// leaves the snapshot, and don't confuse a genuinely new dialog for the
// dismissed one) repeated once per family — and two of the thirteen copies were
// missing them, which is exactly the bug this replaced. Declaring a family here
// gets all four for free; forgetting them is no longer possible.
//
// A family is declared with registerDialog() and never calls its own refresh:
// syncDialogs(scene) drives all of them once per poll, in registration order.

// Every registered family, in registration order (windows layer in that order
// on a poll that opens several at once).
const dialogFamilies = [];

// How a family decides WHICH windows should exist:
//   "list"   the snapshot's list IS the window set — open what appears, close
//            what disappears. The default, and what most dialogs are.
//   "seq"    the item carries a monotonic open-counter; a window opens only when
//            that counter ADVANCES, so closing one locally doesn't reopen it
//            while the item lingers in the snapshot. Still auto-closes when the
//            item leaves. (Treasure maps: the server re-sends the same map item
//            on every update, and only a fresh 0x90/0xF5 bumps `openSeq`.)
//   "local"  app code owns opening and closing (a double-click, a 0x24 event);
//            the snapshot only supplies CONTENT. Never auto-opens, never
//            auto-closes. (Containers.)
const OPEN_POLICIES = new Set(["list", "seq", "local"]);

// How a family suppresses a window the player closed, until the server agrees:
//   "content"  remember key → signature; skip while the snapshot still shows
//              that exact content. If the server sends DIFFERENT content under
//              the same key that's a real new dialog, so it opens. Needed
//              wherever the transport can reuse a key (World::add_gump upserts
//              gumps by serial).
//   "session"  remember the key alone; skip until the key leaves the snapshot.
//              For dialogs whose content keeps changing right up until the
//              server tears them down — a trade's items and offered gold move
//              after the player hits cancel, and a content-keyed guard would let
//              one of those updates reopen the window.
//   "none"     nothing closes locally; the window only ever goes away because
//              the server dropped the item. (The house-design panel: its ✕ asks
//              the server to end the session and waits for that to land.)
const DISMISS_POLICIES = new Set(["content", "session", "none"]);

// Declare a dialog family. Fields:
//   id       name, for errors and debugging
//   source   (scene) => items[]. A singleton dialog returns [] or [theOne];
//            that's the whole reason singletons need no special case here.
//            Omitted for open:"local" (there is no server-side list).
//   key      (item) => stable identity (serial, seq, composite string, …).
//            Windows are kept in a Map under this.
//   sig      (item, scene) => string, the content signature: what "changed"
//            means. `scene` is there for families whose content lives outside
//            their own item (a trade's goods are in scene.contItems). For
//            open:"local" it takes (scene, key) instead, since there is no item.
//            Omit when content never changes after build.
//   seq      (item) => number. Required for open:"seq".
//   build    (item, ctx) => win, where win is at least { el }. ctx is
//            {key, sig, scene, previous}; `previous` is the window being replaced on a
//            rebuild (else undefined), so a family can carry LOCAL ui state
//            across server-driven content changes — the selected page of a
//            multi-page gump, say, which the server's refresh shouldn't reset.
//   update   (win, item, ctx) => void. Optional. WITH it, a signature change
//            updates the window in place; WITHOUT it, a signature change tears
//            the window down and rebuilds it (right for gumps/menus, whose
//            layout is server-authored and can change wholesale).
//   close    (win, key) => void. Optional teardown; defaults to removing win.el.
//            Use it for families that hold state beyond the element.
//   reopen   (win, item) => void. open:"seq" only: the server re-issued a dialog
//            that is ALREADY open (the counter advanced but the window never
//            went away) — raise it, rather than silently doing nothing.
