//! The Observation/Action contract — the stable seam between the world and a
//! brain (AI or a human's input) or a renderer.
//!
//! - [`Observation`] is a read-only snapshot the brain consumes; build it with
//!   [`World::observe`].
//! - [`Action`] is a high-level intent the brain emits; a driver
//!   ([`anima-net`]'s `Session`) turns it into packets.
//!
//! Keeping this schema stable lets scripted / RL / LLM brains and the
//! native/WASM backends all plug into the same interface (see DESIGN.md §3).
